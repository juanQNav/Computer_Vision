In the ISI program at UASLP.

## Content
The repository is organized by partials and includes:
- **Partial 1**: Digital image processing, convolution filters, matrix rotations.
- **Partial 2**: Classifiers, eye detection with OpenCV, LIFT method, high-level computer vision.
- **Partial 3**: Object detection, model evaluation, convolutional neural networks (CNN).

Each folder contains notebooks, PDF documents, LaTeX files, and scripts related to the course topics.

## Requirements
